This is a fairly sophisticated example. I recommend playing around 
with the application, identifying a feature, then perusing the code
to figure out that feature alone. As you identify other features you're
curious about, go back to the code and try to decipher those in isolation
as well. We will cover a few of the techniques I've employed in next week's
intermediate JS lesson. Thanks for looking.
